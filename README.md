# Python-Final-Project
The dataset SeoulBikeData shows how many bikes are rented at a specific date and with a certain context: humidity level, temperature, visibility, season and many more. It initially contains 8760 rows and 14 columns. 
The goal is to isolate our “rented bike count” column and try to predict how many bikes will be rented at a given time. To do so we, first, cleaned our dataset by removing “not a number” values. Then we have exploded the column “Date” to have the year, month, and day. This is how we could plot graphs to see the evolution of the rented bikes. 
We also tried to see the “p-values” and the existing correlations between our different variables. Indeed,
